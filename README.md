# Adaptive Graph Embedding with Consistency and Specificity for Domain Adaptation

This repository contains the codes of the Adaptive Graph Embedding with Consistency and Specificity for Domain Adaptation (AGE-CS), which is accepted by "IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA" in 2022. If you have any question, please feel free to contact with me (coding495@163.com).  

Apart from this, I would like to introduce [another repository](https://github.com/zzf495/Re-implementations-of-SDA) that integrates some shallow domain adaptation methods. I h ope this can help.  

## Code files (matlab implementation)

AGE_CS.m : the implementation of AGE-CS;  

AGE.m: the implementation of Adaptive Graph Embedding (AGE), which adaptively adjust the parameters of the similarity;   

demo.m: experimental demonstration on Office (surf) dataset.
