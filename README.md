# Adaptive Graph Embedding with Consistency and Specificity for Domain Adaptation

This repository contains the codes of the AGE-CS.

Apart from this, I would like to introduce [another repository](https://github.com/zzf495/Re-implementations-of-SDA) that integrates some shallow domain adaptation methods. I hope this can help.

## Code files (matlab implementation)

AGE_CS.m : the implementation of AGE-CS;

AGE.m: the implementation of Adaptive Graph Embedding (AGE), which adaptively adjust the parameters of the similarity;

demo.m: experimental demonstration on Office (surf) dataset.
